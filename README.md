# Sequence  Generator (using SystemVerilog)

A **SystemVerilog-based Sequence 123064 Generator** designed to generate and manipulate numeric sequences using hardware description language (HDL). This project includes a sequence generator module and an accompanying **testbench** for verification.

âœ¨ Features
- **Generates numeric sequences** (e.g., arithmetic, geometric progressions)
- Implemented in **SystemVerilog** for simulation and hardware synthesis
- Includes a **testbench** to verify the functionality of the sequence generator
- Supports configurable **start value**, **step value**, and **length** for sequence generation
- Easy to integrate with other SystemVerilog projects
